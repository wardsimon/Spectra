<p>\subsection{Loading spectra}
<p>Spectra can be loaded using the command file loads.
<br>This makes use of the standard MFIT/MVIEW load routines
<br>to load the data into a data structure.
<p>For example, the SPEC data file 'spec.01' maybe loaded into
<br>the data structure 's1' using the following command
<p>>>s1=loads('specbatch','spec.01,X=K,Y=Detector,S=3');
<p>Here 'specbatch' specifies the standard
<br>MFIT/MVIEW load routine for SPEC type data files, and
<br>the line 'spec.01,X=K,Y=Detector,S=3' causes the
<br>3rd scan from the file 'spec.01' to be loaded with
<br>the x varible equal to 'K' and the Y variable set to
<br>'Detector'.
<p>s1 is a data structure defined in 'spec1d.m' to be
<p>s1.x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp; x-data
<br>s1.y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp; y-data
<br>s1.e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp; error on y
<br>s1.x_label&nbsp; : Label for x-axis
<br>s1.y_label&nbsp; : Label for y-axis
<br>s1.datafile : Data file from which the scan was loaded
<br>s1.yfit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Fitted value
of data
<p>\subsection{Basic plotting}
<p>A basic plot of the spectra can be generated with the
<br>plot command, eg.
<p>>>plot(s1);
<p>Two or more spectra can be overlayed
<p>>>plot(s1,s2,s3);
<p>Most properties of the graph can be edited by clicking on the
<br>appropriate feature. Left click on the lables to edit them.
<br>Right click on the lines to edit them.
<p>\subsection{Simple operations}
<p>Simple arithmetic operations may be performed on the
<br>spectra using the plus '+', minus '-', element-by-element
<br>multiplication '.*', and simple element-by-element divide
<br>'./'.
<p>Note: these operations require that the spectra have
<br>identical x-values. If this is not the case then the
<br>spectra have to be first interpolated, or in the case of
<br>'+' 'combine' may be used.
<p>For example, suppose we wish to load scans 3, 4 and 5 from
<br>file 'spec.01' and then process them using simple
<br>arithmetic.
<p>First load the scans into workspaces:
<p>>>s3=loads('specbatch','spec.01,X=K,Y=Detector,S=3');
<br>>>s4=loads('specbatch','spec.01,X=K,Y=Detector,S=4');
<br>>>s5=loads('specbatch','spec.01,X=K,Y=Detector,S=5');
<p>We can now add the three spectra and view the result
<br>by typing:
<p>>>r=s3+s4+s5;
<br>>>plot(r);
<p>Alternatively s5 could be subtracted from the sum of
<br>s3 and s4.
<p>>>r=s3+s4-s5;
<br>>>plot(r);
<p>The operators '.*' and './' work in a similar way,
<br>e.g.
<p>>>r=s3.*s4;
<p>or even
<p>>>r=2.*s4-s3;
<p>It is possible to append spectra as follows
<p>>>r=[s1;s2;s3;s4];
<p>\subsection{Other operations}
<p>These will be added to with time.
<br>See the help section of the individual commands.
<br>Presently supported commands include:
<p>\subsubsection{combine}
<p>This is used to combine data points when averaging spectra that
<br>do not have the same x-values, e.g.,
<p>>>r=combine(0.01,s1,s2,s3);
<p>Averages points in spectra s1, s2, and s3 that do not differ by
<br>0.01 in their x values. This can also be used as a crude rebinning
<br>of one spectra
<p>>>r=combine(0.01,s1);
<p>\subsubsection{cut}
<p>\subsubsection{disp}
<p>\subsubsection{extract}
<p>\subsubsection{fits}
<p>\subsection{formatpars}
<p>\subsection{gfields}
<p>\subsubsection{peakm}
<p>\subsubsection{peakt}
<p>\subsection{rebin}
<p>\subsection{sfields}
<p>\subsubsection{transform}
<p>spectrum_out=transform(transform_function,spectrum_in,args)
<p>Transform spectrum according to the transform function, e.g.,
<p>>>r=transform('normalise',spectra,1)
<p>Currently available transform functions include:
<p>- r=transform('normalise',spectra,normalisation_value);
<br>- r=transform('dydx'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,spectra);
